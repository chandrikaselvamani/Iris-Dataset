A decision tree is a supervised learning technique which has a response variable and is most often used in classification problems. The tree can be applied to either categorical or continuous variables. The process resembles a flow chart, with each non-leaf internal node as test of an attribute, each branch is the result of that test, and each leaf, terminal node contains a class label. The uppermost node in the tree is called the root node.
